  <!-- The Task Tree  
    o Build a complete tree here
    o Each plugin gets loaded exactly once, will only be bound to the LAST node it's 
        name is found in
    o Typical node looks like so:
          <node name="nUsers" text="" description="" plugin="CreateUsersAndGroups" />
      name: name of node in tree
      text: visible text in tree (overrides plugin.text)
      description: tooltip (overrides plugin.description)
      plugin: the plugin to bind here 
		This is also the DLL name without extension.
		By convention the dll should expose the same name via its NAME property
      
    o Optional node attribute: ensureVisible (boolean)
