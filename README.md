YuniquePLM Binary Distribution System (BiDS)
====

YuniquePLM Binary Distribution System is intended to be a quick and easy way to distribute CDs.

GIT has a very nice way of compressing and deduplicating entire file systems then providing snapshots.  This will allow us to clone a repository on several machines, and as new CDs are produced there is only a very small cost in downloading this new CD.
